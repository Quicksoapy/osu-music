# osu-music
Exports music from the rhythm game osu!

This is a c# console application, where you can fill in the directory of your osu! songs folder, and it will cycle through every folder within said directory, grabbing the metadata
out of the text file (either original text or in the english alphabet), grabbing the background to use as picture (optional), and grabbing the music file to add the metadata and image to, and export it into a chosen directory.
